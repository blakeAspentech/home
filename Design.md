## Section 1: Principles
 ### Purpose
  The purpose of a game can vary between educational, escapist, creative-- but ultimately, in order to succeed at any of those secondary goals, a game must be engaging to players. One key way to be engaging that a lot of games take these days is to be addicting. I do not want to purposefully create an addictive system-- instead, I would prefer for the game to be engaging for players because it is fun. This may inadvertently create addictive gameplay, but at its core, <ins>**the game should be designed for fun**</ins>.

### Cautions
  _"Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game."_ - [game dev saying](https://www.designer-notes.com/game-developer-column-17-water-finds-a-crack/)

If a game is fun and has goals for the player, players will try and find ways to progress as fast as possible, whether afk controller rubber banding, or exploiting game mechanics. There aren't many solutions to this problem, but there are plenty of pitfalls to avoid.
  - #### Hidden Numbers
    Hiding progression beyond player view or hiding specific statistics like damage or attack speed will not stop the players from trying to optimise these aspects. It will force them to leave the game and check a game wiki or online guide, which only serves to break immersion and frustrate the player. If you are removing numbers for art style or accessability's sake, consider leaving an option to enable them. Such options/abilities could be progression-locked or made more immersive, as to <ins>**allow the player to engage in the game the way they want to**</ins>.
  - #### Mechanical Exploits
    Players <ins>will</ins> find exploits to the game. The goal should not be to minimize these exploits or nerf game mechanics, but to instead try to approach them in a way that allows the players to feel smart, while not ruining the rest of the fun of the game. For example: If a player breaks into an area before they're supposed to be there, and gets a quest item, they might be able to insta-finish a late game quest. If doing so breaks the quest/the game, that will obviously impact the player hugely. If the game error handles and takes away a reward from the player for doing so, that will also be frustrating for them. The best form of error handling is making the game not so wholely dependent on one item that it becomes un-fun. Consider getting a one hit kill weapon in skyrim using the restoration alchemy loop. Even with combat being trivialized, the locations, dungeons, quests, etc are all still fun. Having fun in gameplay not governed by mechanics is essential for this-- and I would advocate that this is where <ins>**meticulous design is better than procedural generation**</ins> in games.
  - #### Inherent Imbalance
    Some ways of playing may end up giving more rewards or xp to the player than others. It is important to keep in mind that <ins>**the game does not have to be balanced, but all intended ways of playing should be viable and rewarding**</ins>. If one way is substantially more rewarding, that may make the other inherently less fun, if not unviable. Try not to nerf, and try to buff not by increasing numbers but by changing or adding abilities.
